      <p>Strategic planning is becoming increasingly important as a means to
      help state and metropolitan area governments select policies and actions
      to address pressing issues that are fraught with uncertainty. More
      specifically, Federal direction has challenged state, regional, and local
      transportation agencies with measuring the outcomes of decisions through
      performance-based planning, including considering how transportation
      solutions may impact future goals such as sustainability, health,
      mobility, etc. Further complicating matters, plans need to be resilient to
      changing transportation and land use trends and the implications of
      emerging technologies and constraints.  VisionEval is an open source
      common framework building on the successful GreenSTEP family of strategic
      planning tools that is intended to address these needs.</p>
      <p>VisionEval is a recently established partnership merging this family of
      tools into an open-source project with a supporting community forum of
      partner agencies and others sharing in its use and enhancement.  The goal
      is to support a broad array of potential tool uses and enable pooled
      enhancements expanding the types of outcomes measured or refine the
      specificity of transportation and land use solutions considered. The work
      to date by the founding FHWA-OregonDOT partnership has focused on the
      technical components of putting the various tools on a common programming
      framework. Bolstered by interest at an RPAT Peer Exchange in October 2015,
      efforts are underway to build a supportive community around the tool,
      drawing from successful past and interested future users nationally, who
      will both define the policy needs and uses of these tools, and set their
      direction moving forward.</p>

            <div class="panel-body">
              <p>The family of VisionEval tools began with a tool designed to
              measure GHG emission outcomes in Oregon (GreenSTEP). It was
              rebranded the Regional Strategic Planning Model (RSPM) when
              broader measures such as health, household costs, and other
              outcomes were added.  The tool was adapted nationally in modified
              form as RPAT (Rapid Policy Assessment Tool) and EERPAT (Energy and
              Emissions Reduction Policy Analysis Tool). This tool evaluates
              transportation investment and policy strategies such as increased
              transit service, pricing, parking management, etc. combined with
              land use plans to assess how different combinations of investment
              and policy actions impact travel behavior and budgets and thus
              influence desired community outcomes/goals. The short runtimes
              enable thousands of scenarios to be evaluated testing plan
              resilience and has resulted in several web-based interactive
              visualization tools to explore policy/investment trade-offs with
              stakeholders and the public.</p>
              <p>Oregon has found significant value in RSPM to support
              performance-based planning in developing future plans, and most
              MPOs in the state are using the it (and in some cases RPAT), with
              future interest in enhancements. Several current and past pilot
              users of RPAT and EERPAT across the country continue to find value
              from the tool in greenhouse gas planning efforts.  This project
              builds on these collective achievements and allows pooling of
              resources and energy that will result in better tools, increased
              user base, a larger pool of technical developers, and a community
              forum sharing best practices in how the tools are supporting land
              use and transportation decision-making conversations across the
              nation.</p>

              The core of VisionEval is a common programming framework that
              allow the four strategic planning models in the GreenSTEP family
              to share a commmon platform, facilitating development and
              deployment to a broader community. The framework enables
              statewide, regional, or urban area models to be built by
              connecting together modules that are distributed in standard
              R language packages. The framework establishes interface standards
              for modules and manages the data flow between modules and a common
              datastore. Although the inspiration for the VisionEval framework
              is a set of related transportation and land use models
              (see below), the framework can be used for other modeling and
              research purposes as well. The VisionEval project
              <a href="https://github.com/gregorbj/VisionEval">repository</a>
              on GitHub is the source for project documentation and code.

              the potential for influencing those trends and their effects, and
              develop a strategic vision for the future. A strategic vision
              identifies desired performance goals and general strategies for

              Strategic planning models evaluate the consequences of future
              scenarios that vary with respect to external trends and proposed
              policy responses to those trends. Strategic planning models are
              designed to address a wide range of trends and policies, rather
              than focusing on details. They are designed in this way so that
              many alternative futures and policies can be evaluated, enabling
              planners to reason more effectively about intended and unintended
              consequences of prospective policies. Disaggregate strategic
              planning models work by simulating the effects of trends and
              policies on individual households. This has been found to be an
              efficient way to model the interactions between policies and their
              potential effects on households having different characteristics
              and located in different areas.

                <dd>The Greenhouse gas Strategic Transportation Energy Planning
                  model was the first of these models to be developed. It was
                  developed by the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) to
                  assist in the development of plans to reduce greenhouse gas
                  (GHG) emissions from light-duty vehicles to meet statutory
                  goals. GreenSTEP models the effects of many different factors
                  (e.g. transportation supply, prices, land use, etc.) on
                  household vehicle ownership and use, and the effects on
                  emissions, traffic congestion, etc. Technical documentation

                  scenario plans. It is a revision of an earlier model named
                  "Metropolitan GreenSTEP". The name was changed because the
                  model (like GreenSTEP) does much more than estimate GHG

              A benefit of using strategic planning models is that they enable
              a large number of scenarios to be evaluated. This provides
              planners with more information about the potential consequences
              of future trends and the policies that might be put in place to
              influence those trends and their effects. This benefit also poses
              a challenge in regards to how to make sense of the large amounts
              of output data that are produced. Fortunately, the worldwide web
