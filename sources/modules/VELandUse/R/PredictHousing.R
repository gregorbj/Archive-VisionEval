## PredictHousing Module
#### November 6, 2018
#
#This module assigns a housing type, either single-family (SF) or multifamily (MF) to *regular* households based on the respective supplies of SF and MF dwelling units in the housing market to which the household is assigned (i.e. the Azone the household is assigned to) and on household characteristics. It then assigns each household to a Bzone based on the household's housing type and income quartile as well as the supply of housing by type and Bzone (an input) and the distribution of households by income quartile for each Bzone (an input). The module assigns non-institutional group quarters *households* to Bzones based on the supply of group quarters units by Bzone.
#
### Model Parameter Estimation
#
#A binomial logit model is used to assign housing types to households. The model is estimated using a Census Public Use Microsample (PUMS) dataset (Hh_df) that is prepared by the *CreateEstimationDatasets.R* script in the *VESimHouseholds* package. For more information on the preparation of the *Hh_df* dataset and how to substitute regional data for the default package data, refer to the documentation in the *CreateEstimationDatasets.R* script. The binomial logit model predicts the likelihood that a household will reside in a single-family dwelling as a function of the age group of the head of the household, the ratio of the natural log of the household income to the natural log of the mean household income (log income ratio), the household size, and the interaction of the log income ratio and household size. The age group of the head of household is the oldest age group in the household. The summary statistics for this model are as follows:
#
#<txt:HouseTypeModel_ls$Summary>
#
#The results of applying the binomial logit model are constrained to match the housing *choice* proportions with the dwelling unit proportions by successively adjusting the intercept of the model using a binary search algorithm.
#
### How the Module Works
#
#The module carries out the following series of calculations to assign a housing type (SF or MF) to each *regular* household and to assign each household to a Bzone location.
#
#1) The proportions of SF and MF dwelling units in the Azone are calculated.
#
#2) The binomial logit is applied to each household in the Azone to determine the household's housing type. The model is applied multiple times using a binary search algorithm to successively adjust the model intercept until the housing type *choice* proportions equal the housing unit proportions in the Azone.
#
#3) The income quartile of each household in the Azone is calculated and a tabulation of households by income quartile and housing type is made.
#
#4) A matrix of the number of housing units by Bzone and housing type is created from the user inputs (e.g. resulting from a land use model or other allocation process). Because the number of housing units may not equal the number of households, the number of units by type and Bzone are adjusted so that the total number by type equals the number of households by housing type.
#
#5) A matrix of the proportions of households by income quartile and Bzone is created from the user inputs (e.g. resulting from Census tabulation with adjustments as deemed appropriate) and the tabulation of housing units by Bzone.
#
#6) An iterative proportional fitting (IPF) process is used to balance the number of housing units over 3 dimensions: Bzone, unit type, and income quartile. Two matrixes are used as margin control totals for the balancing process. The first is the matrix of demand by housing type and income quartile (step #3). The second is a matrix of units by Bzone and housing type (step #4). The seed matrix for the IPF uses the matrix of household proportions by Bzone and income quartile. The IPF is constrained to produce whole numbers.
#
#7) After the number of housing units is allocated to each Bzone, housing type, and income quartile, households are allocated to Bzones to fill those units. This is done by iterating through each housing type and income quartile combination and doing the following: Extracting a vector of units by Bzone for the type and quartile combination;  Using the vector as replication weights to replicate the Bzone names; Randomizing the Bzone name vector; Assigning the randomized Bzone name vector to households matching the type and quartile combination.

#Non-institutionalized group-quarters *households* are assigned randomly to Bzones based on the number of group-quarters *housing units* in each Bzone.

#SECTION 3: DEFINE FUNCTIONS THAT IMPLEMENT THE SUBMODEL
#=======================================================
#This function predicts the housing type each household. It uses the estimated
#binomial choice model for determining the probability that the housing choice
#for each household is single family (SF) vs. multifamily (MF). The group
#quarters population is assigned to group quarters (GQ).

#Iterative proportional fitting function used in Bzone allocation
#----------------------------------------------------------------
#' Iterative proportional fitting function.
#'
#' \code{ipf} fits values in array to match margins.
#'
#' This function uses an iterative proportional fitting algorithm to calculate
#' the values in an array to so that specified margin sums are matched. The
#' function was written specifically to meet the needs of balancing housing
#' units by type and household income quartile by Bzone with the housing demand
#' for households by Azone. The function was not written for general use and
#' so does not contain checks to assure that function arguments are proper.
#'
#' @param Seed_ar A array of starting numbers for the calculation. The
#' dimensions of this array must be the same as the dimensions of the desired
#' result and with the dimensions of the margins used at control totals.
#' @param MrgnVals_ls A list of vectors, matrices, or arrays for margin sum
#' control totals. The list needs to provide controls for each margin of the
#' array. For example, in the case of it's use in this module, two matrices are
#' used as control totals to balance a 3-dimensional array of housing units by
#' Bzone, housing type, and household income quartile. One matrix has control
#' totals by Bzone and housing type. The other matrix has control totals by
#' housing type and income quartile. Note that if one or more margins share the
#' same dimension, the totals for the shared dimension must be the same.
#' @param MrgnDims_ls A list of vectors where each vector identifies the
#' dimensions of the 'Seed_ar' that a margin control corresponds to. For example
#' if the 'Seed_ar' has 3 dimensions and a margin control matrix corresponds to
#' the 2nd and 3rd dimensions of the 'Seed_ar' (i.e. the 1st dimension of the
#' control matrix corresponds to the 2nd dimension of the array and the 2nd
#' dimension of the control matrix corresponds to the 3rd dimension of the
#' array), then the entry for that control matrix would be c(2,3). The number
#' of components in 'MrgnDims_ls' and the order of those components must be
#' consistent with 'MrgnVals_ls'.
#' @param RmseTarget A scalar numeric value specifying the maximum root mean square
#' error between the margin control values and the corresponding array sums. The
#' default value is 1e-7.
#' @param MaxIter A scalar numeric value specifying the maximum number of
#' iterations for balancing the array over the specified dimensions.
#' @return An array containing values that meet the margin controls.

#Main module function that assigns housing type and Bzone for each household
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#' Main module function that assigns the housing type and Bzone for each
#' household.
#'
#' \code{PredictHousing} predicts the housing type and Bzone for each household.
#'
#' This function predicts the housing choice of each household. It uses the
#' estimated models of binomial choice model for determining the probability
#' that the housing choice for each household is single family (SF) vs.
#' multifamily (MF). The group quarters population is assigned to group quarters
#' (GQ). After the housing choice is assigned, the household is assigned to a
#' Bzone based on the input assumptions of:
#' 1) housing supply by type for each Bzone
#' 2) distribution of households by income quartile for each Bzone
#' Housing demand by Bzone, type, and income quartile is balanced allocated
#' by iterative proportional fitting. Households are assigned randomly to Bzones
#' based on their housing choice and income quartile and the balanced quantity
#' of housing in each Bzone by income quartile and housing type.
#'
#' @param L A list containing the components listed in the Get specifications
#' for the module.
#' @return A list containing the components specified in the Set
#' specifications for the module.

  #Balance housing units with housing demand and assign households to locations
  #----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  #Each Azone is a housing market. The number of housing units by type and
  #income quartile for Bzones in the Azone is balanced with the number of
  #households by house type and income quartile. Iterative proportional fitting
  #(IPF) is used to balance housing units over 3 dimensions: Bzone, unit type,
  #and income quartile. Two matrixes are used as margin control totals for the
  #balancing process. The first is a matrix of demand by housing type and income
  #quartile which is calculated above by Azone (HhTab_HtIq_Az). The second is a
  #matrix of units by Bzone and housing type. This matrix is created by scaling
  #the number of input units by Bzone and housing type to match the demand by
  #housing type. Scaled values are converted to whole numbers in the process.
  #The seed matrix for the IPF uses the input assumptions for proportion of
  #households by type (bzone_hh_inc_qrtl_prop.csv input file) to arrive at a
  #balanced distribution of households by income for each Bzone that reflects
  #household income differences among Bzones. After units are allocated to
  #Bzones to match the number of units demanded by households, each household is
  #assigned to a Bzone. This is done by iterating through each housing type and
  #income quartile combination and:
  #1) Extract the vector of units by Bzone for the type/quartile combination,
  #2) Using the vector as replication weights to replicate the Bzone names
  #3) Randomize the Bzone name vector
  #4) Assign the randomized Bzone name vector to households matching the
  #type/quartile combination.
