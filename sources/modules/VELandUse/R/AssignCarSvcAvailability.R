## AssignCarSvcAvailability Module
#### November 6, 2018
#
#This module reads in and assigns car service availability in Bzones. Car services include taxis, car sharing services (e.g. Car-To-Go, Zipcar), and future automated taxi services. A user input file identifies which Bzones have high or low levels of service. A high car service level is one that has access times that are competitive with private car use. This means that the time it takes for a taxi service to pick up a passenger or that time it takes to get to a car share car is not much longer than the time to get to and from a vehicle owned by a household, especially when considering that a car service may be able to drop off the passengers at the destination, or may have preferential parking, thus avoiding time to park a private vehicle and walk to the destination. High level of car service is considered to increase household car availability similar to owning a car. Low level car service does not have competitive access time and is not considered as increasing household car availability.
#
### Model Parameter Estimation
#
#This module has no model parameters.
#
### How the Module Works
#
#The user specifies the level of car service availability (Low or High) by Bzone. The module assigns that level to each household based on the Bzone the household resides in.
