#BudgetHouseholdDvmt.R
#=====================
#This module adjusts average household DVMT to keep the quantity within
#household operating cost limits. The limit for each household is calculated in
#several steps. First, the proportion of the household's income that may be
#spent on vehicle operating costs is calculated using a model that is explained
#below. This is called the budget proportion. Then an adjusted household income
#for budget calculation purposes is calculated by adding the annual cost of
#insurance for households subscribing to payd-as-you-drive (PAYD) insurance,
#cash-out parking payments for workers who work at an employer that has
#cash-out-buy-back parking, and any vehicle ownership cost savings for
#households that substitute high level car service for one or more household
#vehicles. The adjusted household income is muliplied by the budget proportion
#and divided by the average vehicle operating cost per mile for the household
#to determine the maximum household DVMT that fits within the household budget.
#The household DVMT is then set at the lesser of this budget maximum or the
#modeled household DVMT.
#
#The budget proportion model is estimated using data from the Bureau of Labor's
#consumer expenditure survey for the years from 2003 to 2015. The data used
#are the nominal dollar expenditures by household income category and year
#by transportation category. The values for the operating cost categories
#(gas and oil, and maintenance and repair) are summed and then divided by the
#midpoint value for each income category to calculate the budget proportion for
#each income group and each year. From this the mean value is computed for each
#income group. The budget proportions for each income group and year are
#divided by the mean values by income group to normalize values. The standard
#deviation for the combined normalized values is computed and value of 3
#deviations above the mean is set as the maximum normalized value. The mean
#values by income group are multiplied by this normalized maximum to derive a
#budget proportion maximum by income group. A smoothed splines model of the
#budget proportion as a function of income is then estimated from the calculated
#budget proportion maximums. This model is used to calculate the budget
#proportion for a household based on the household income. The minimum and
#maximum values of the calculated budget proportion maximums are used as
#constraints to avoid unreasonable results for very low incomes and very high
#incomes.
