## AssignHhVehiclePowertrain Module
#### November 24, 2018
#
#This module assigns a powertrain type to each household vehicle. The powertrain types are internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV), hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV), and battery electric vehicles (BEV). The module also assigns related characteristics to household vehicles including:
#
#* Battery range (for PHEV and BEV)
#
#* Miles per gallon (MPG) and gallons per mile (GPM)
#
#* Miles per kilowatt-hour (MPKWH) and kilowatt-hours per mile (KWHPM)
#
#* Miles per gasoline gallon equivalent (MPGe)
#
#* The proportion of DVMT powered by electricity
#
#* Carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per mile powered by hydrocarbon fuel
#
#* Carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per mile powered by electricity
#
### Model Parameter Estimation
#
#Most of the module calculations require no estimated models. The procedures for these calculations are described in the next section. However, models are estimated to calculate the proportions of PHEV vehicle travel powered by electricity vs. fuel. Those proportions will vary depending on the day-to-day travel patterns of households. A household which travels short distances on most days may power most of their travel by their battery which is charged up overnight.
#
#The model to calculate the proportion of PHEV travel powered by electricity assumes that a PHEV will be fully charged once per day and that the vehicle will be powered by electricity up to the specified battery range. Travel exceeding the battery range will be powered by fuel. It is also assumed that travel will vary from day to day so that the proportion of travel powered by electricity will not be the ratio of the battery range and average daily vehicle miles of travel (DVMT). For example, if a household has a PHEV whose battery range is greater than the average DVMT for the vehicle, not all of the vehicle travel will be powered by electricity because there will be some days when the vehicle is driven beyond the vehicle's battery range.
#
#To estimate the proportion of a PHEV travel powered by electricity, it is assumed that the variation in the vehicle's DVMT is the same as the variation in household DVMT as simulated by the CalculateHouseholdDvmt module in the VEHouseholdTravel package. That module includes polynomial regression models for calculating DVMT percentiles (from 5% to 95% at 5% intervals) as a function of the average household DVMT. There are separate models for metropolitan and non-metropolitan households.
#
#The estimated models take the form of lookup tables which calculate the proportion of travel powered by electricity for combinations of average DVMT and battery range. The average DVMT values range from 5 to 200 miles in 5 mile increments. The battery range values range from 5 to 150 miles in 5 mile increments. Two such lookup tables are created, one for metropolitan households (those residing in an urbanized area) and non-metropolitan households (those residing outside of an urbanized area). For each location type (metropolitan vs. non-metropolitan) and each combination of DVMT and battery range, the DVMT percentile models for the location type are run. These are the percentile models estimated and included in the CalculateHouseholdDvmt module. Running the DVMT percentile models produces the DVMT at different percentiles from the 5th percentile to the 95th percentile in 5% increments and the 99th percentile. A smooth spline curve is fitted to these values to cover all percentiles from 0 to 100. The percentile corresponding to the battery range is predicted using the smooth spline curve relationship. Then the DVMT traveled below the battery range and DVMT traveled above the battery range is calculated from integrating the smooth spline curve using the battery range percentile threshold. The DVMT powered by electricity is then calculated as follows:
#
#  ElecDvmt = DvmtBelow + Range * (100 - RangePctl)
#
#  Where:
#
#  * ElecDvmt is the DVMT powered by electricity
#
#  * DvmtBelow is the sum of DVMT below the range percentile described above
#
#  * Range is the battery range
#
#  * RangePctl is the battery range percentile described above
#
#Once the DVMT powered by electricity is calculated, the proportion of DVMT powered by electricity is calculated as follows:
#
#  ElecProp = ElecDvmt / (DvmtBelow + DvmtAbove)
#
#  Where:
#
#  * ElecDvmt is as described above
#
#  * DvmtBelow + DvmtAbove is the sum of all DVMT below and above the battery range percentile
#
#These calculations are done for every combination of DVMT and battery range for metropolitan and non-metropolitan households to produce a metropolitan lookup table and a non-metropolitan lookup table. The values in the tables are smoothed using smooth splines; first by smoothing the values in the columns (battery range) and then smoothing the values in rows (average DVMT). The following figures illustrate the relationships of electrically-powered DVMT, average DVMT, and battery range for metropolitan and non-metropolitan household vehicles.

### How the Module Works
#
#Assignment of powertrains is done by vehicle type (Auto, LtTrk) and model year. For each type and model year, vehicles of that type and model year are assigned powertrains in the order of BEV, PHEV, HEV, and ICEV.
#
#The assignment of BEVs is conditional on the whether the 95th percentile DVMT for the vehicle is within the battery range of the vehicle and whether charging the vehicle is possible at the residence. The battery range of the vehicle is determined by the age and type of vehicle. Battery range is a BEV powertrain characteristic as described in the documentation for `PowertrainFuelDefaults_ls`. Charging possibilities are determined by household based on the housing type and charging availability by housing type by azone in the `azone_charging_availability.csv` input file. Charging availability is specified as a proportion of housing units that have chargers or could have chargers installed. Households are randomly selected based on the input proportions. It is assumed that if charging is available for a household, then all vehicles in the household have charging available. If there are not enough qualifying vehicles to match the charging and battery range assumptions, then the number of BEVs that can't be assigned are designated as PHEVs. The range criterion is not used in assigning PHEVs, but the charging criterion is. The PHEV designation is only assigned to vehicles where residential charging is available. If there are not enough qualifying vehicles, then the number of PHEVs that can't be assigned to a vehicle are designated as HEVs. There are no qualifications for HEVs and ICEVs and their numbers are assigned randomly to vehicles that have no assignment.
#
#The vehicle MPG (GPM) and MPKWH (KWHPM) characteristics are determined by the vehicle powertrain, vehicle age, and vehicle type by looking up the corresponding values in the household powertrain table.
#
#The proportion of DVMT powered by electricity is either 1 for BEVs or 0 for ICEVs and HEVs. To calculate the proportion for PHEVs, it is assumed that household DVMT is split equally among household vehicles. Then the proportion is determined from the estimated lookup table using the vehicle DVMT and battery range.
#
#Carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per mile from fuel are calculated by converting the gallons per mile (GPM) which are in gasoline gallon equivalents to megajoules per mile and multiplying by the average carbon intensity for the vehicle type. Carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per mile from electricity are calculated similarly by converting kilowatts to megajoules.

#Model proportions of PHEV travel powered by electricity
#-------------------------------------------------------
#This model estimates the proportions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV)
#travel powered by electricity. The model assumes that a PHEV will be fully
#charged once per day and that the vehicle will be powered by electricity up to
#the specified battery range. Travel exceeding the battery range will be powered
#by gasoline. It is also assumed that travel will vary from day to day so that
#the proportion of travel powered by electricity will not be the ratio of the
#battery range and average daily vehicle miles of travel (DVMT). For example,
#if a household has a PHEV whose battery range is greater than the average DVMT
#for the vehicle, not all of the vehicle travel will be powered by electricity
#because there will be some days when the vehicle is driven beyond the vehicle's
#battery range. To estimate the proportion of a PHEV travel powered by
#electricity, it is assumed that the variation in the vehicle's DVMT is the same
#as the variation in household DVMT as simulated by the CalculateHouseholdDvmt
#module in the VEHouseholdTravel package. That module includes polynomial
#regression models for calculating DVMT percentiles (from 5% to 95% at 5%
#intervals) as a function of the average household DVMT. There are separate
#models for metropolitan and non-metropolitan households. A PHEV power model
#is estimated by first generating lookup tables relating average DVMT to DVMT
#percentiles. The model function then takes an average DVMT and a battery range
#and calculates the proportion of travel powered by electricity.

#SECTION 3: DEFINE FUNCTIONS THAT IMPLEMENT THE SUBMODEL
#=======================================================
#This function assigns powertrain types and several powertrain characteristics
#to household vehicles including:
#Powertrain - ICEV, HEV, PHEV, or BEV
#MPG - fuel economy for the vehicle powertrain, type, and model year for travel
#that is powered by gasoline or other fuel. It is 0 for BEV.
#MPKWH - electric energy efficiency for the vehicle powertrain, type, and model
#year for travel that is powered by stored electricity. It is 0 for ICEV and
#HEV.
#MPGe - Miles per gasoline equivalent gallon for all vehicles where travel using
#stored electricity is converted into gasoline gallon equivalents (based on
#energy content) and the average is calculated by weighting by the proportions
#of vehicle travel using stored electricity and not using stored electricity.
#The proportion of travel using electricity is calculated by split average DVMT
#equally across all household vehicles and comparing to the battery range of the
#vehicle.
#BatRng - The battery range of the vehicle in miles.
