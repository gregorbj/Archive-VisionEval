## PredictWorkers Module
#### September 6, 2018
#
#This module assigns workers by age to households and to noninstitutional group quarters population. It is a simple model which predicts workers as a function of the age composition of household members. There is no responsiveness to jobs or how changes in the job market and demographics might change the worker age composition, but the user may use optional inputs to exogenously adjust relative employment rates by age group, Azone, and year. These optional input values specify by age group, Azone, and year the proportions of persons in the age group and Azone who are workers relative to the proportions in the model estimation year.
#
### Model Parameter Estimation
#This model has just one parameter object, a matrix of the probability that a person in each age group in a specified household type is a worker. The defined household types are the same as the types defined for the CreateHouseholds module.
#
#This probability matrix is created from Census public use microsample (PUMS) data that is compiled by the CreateEstimationDatasets.R script into a R dataset (HhData_df) when the VESimHouseholds package is built. The data that is supplied with the VESimHouseholds package downloaded from the official VisionEval repository may be used, but it is preferrable to use data for the region being modeled. How this is done is explained in the documentation for the *CreateEstimationDatasets.R* script.
#
#To calculate this probability matrix, the numbers of workers by age group and household type and the numbers of persons by age group and household type are tabulated (weighted by the household weights in the PUMS data). The probability that a person is a worker is calculated by dividing the worker tabulation by the population tabulation.
#
### How the Module Works
#The number of workers in each age group of each household is determined through random sampling using the probability for the age group and household type. For example, if a household is of the type *2-0-2-0-0-0*, and the probability that a person of age 20-29 in this household type is a worker is 0.7, then two random samples are taken for this household with a probability of success of 0.7 to determine the number of workers in this age group in the household.
#
#If the user has supplied optional inputs for the ratio of employment for the age group in the forecast year relative to the year of the model estimation dataset, that input is multiplied by the estimated worker probability to determine the sampling probability. For example, if the year of the model estimation data is 2000 and the forecast year is 2010, and if the user specifies that the employment rate of 20-29 year olds in 2010 was 95% of the employment rate of that age group in 2000, then the worker probability in the example above (0.7) is multiplied by 0.95 to calculate the sampling probability.

#The worker model predicts workers as a function of the household type:
#i.e. the number of persons in each of 6 age groups in the household. It is a
#simple stochastic model where the probability that a person in an age group in
#a household type is a worker is the ratio of workers to persons in that age
#group and household type. For the noninstitutionalized group quarters
#population, the probability is the ratio of workers to persons by age group.

#This function predicts the number of workers in each of 6 age groups in each
#household and tallies the total number of workers in the household. It uses
#the matrix of worker proportions by household type and age group as choice
#probabilities for determining the number of workers by age group for each
#household. The relative employment value for each age group, which is the
#employment rate for the age group relative to the employment rate for the
#model estimation year data is used to adjust the relative employment to reflect
#changes in relative employment for other years. For example, the great
#recession of 2007 to 2012 hit the millenial generation particularly hard.
