## AssignTransitService Module
#### November 5, 2018
#
#This module assigns transit service level to the metropolitan area (Marea) and neighborhoods (Bzones). Annual revenue-miles (i.e. transit miles in revenue service) by transit mode type are read from an input file. The following 8 modes are recognized:
#* DR = Demand-responsive
#* VP = Vanpool and similar
#* MB = Standard motor bus
#* RB = Bus rapid transit and commuter bus
#* MG = Monorail/automated guideway
#* SR = Streetcar/trolley bus/inclined plain
#* HR = Heavy Rail/Light Rail
#* CR = Commuter Rail/Hybrid Rail/Cable Car/Aerial Tramway
#
#Revenue miles are converted to bus (i.e. MB) equivalents using factors derived from urbanized are data from the National Transit Database (NTD). Bus-equivalent revenue miles are used in models which predict vehicle ownership and household DVMT.
#
#Revenue miles by mode type are also translated (using NTD data) into vehicle miles by 3 vehicle types: van, bus, and rail. Miles by vehicle type are used to calculate public transit energy consumption and emissions.
#
#The module also reads in user supplied data on relative public transit accessibility by Bzone as explained below.
#
### Model Parameter Estimation
#
#Parameters are calculated to convert the revenue miles for each of the 8 recognized public transit modes into bus equivalents, and to convert revenue miles into vehicle miles. Data extracted from the 2015 National Transit Database (NTD) are used to calculate these parameters. The extracted datasets are in the *2015_Service.csv* and *2015_Agency_information.csv* files in the *inst/extdata* directory of this package. These files contain information about transit service and transit service providers located within urbanized areas. Documentation of the data are contained in the accompanying *2015_Service.txt* and *2015_Agency_information.txt* files.
#
#Bus equivalent factors for each of the 8 modes is calculated on the basis of the average productivity of each mode as measured by the ratio of passenger miles to revenue miles. The bus-equivalency factor of each mode is the ratio of the average productivity of the mode to the average productivity of the bus (MB) mode.
#
#Factors to compute vehicle miles by mode from revenue miles by mode are calculated from the NTD data on revenue miles and deadhead (i.e. out of service) miles. The vehicle mile factor is the sum of revenue and deadhead miles divided by the revenue miles. These factors vary by mode.
#
### How the Module Work
#
#The user supplies data on the annual revenue miles of service by each of the 8 transit modes for the Marea. These revenue miles are converted to bus equivalents using the estimated bus-equivalency factors and summed to calculate total bus-equivalent revenue miles. This value is divided by the urbanized area population of the Marea to compute bus-equivalent revenue miles per capita. This public transit service measure is used in models of household vehicle ownership and household vehicle travel.
#
#The user supplied revenue miles by mode are translated into vehicle miles by mode using the estimated conversion factors. The results are then simplified into 3 vehicle types (Van, Bus, Rail) where the DR and VP modes are assumed to be served by vans, the MB and RB modes are assumed to be served by buses, and the MG, SR, HR, and CR modes are assumed to be served by rail.
#
#The user also supplies information on the aggregate frequency of peak period transit service within 0.25 miles of the Bzone boundary per hour during evening peak period. This is the *D4c* measure included in the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) [Smart Location Database] (https://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/smart-location-database-technical-documentation-and-user-guide). Following is the description of the measure from the user guide:
#>EPA analyzed GTFS data to calculate the frequency of service for each transit route between 4:00 and 7:00 PM on a weekday. Then, for each block group, EPA identified transit routes with service that stops within 0.4 km (0.25 miles). Finally EPA summed total aggregate service frequency by block group. Values for this metric are expressed as service frequency per hour of service.
