## DivertSovTravel Module
#### November 21, 2018
#
#This module reduces household single-occupant vehicle (SOV) travel to achieve goals that are inputs to the model. The purpose of this module is to enable users to do 'what if' analysis of the potential of light-weight vehicles (e.g. bicycles, electric bikes, electric scooters) and infrastructure to support their use to reduce SOV travel. The user inputs a goal for diverting a portion of SOV travel within a 20-mile tour distance (round trip distance). The module predicts the amount of each household's DVMT that occurs in SOV tours having round trip distances of 20 miles or less. It also predicts for each household the average length of trips that are in those SOV tours. It then reduces the SOV travel of each household to achieve the overall goal. The reductions are allocated to households as a function of the household's SOV DVMT and the inverse of SOV trip length (described in more detail below). The proportions of diverted DVMT are saved as are the average SOV trip length of diverted DVMT. These datasets are used in the ApplyDvmtReductions module to calculate reductions in household DVMT and to calculate trips to be added to the bike mode category trips.
#
### Model Parameter Estimation
#
#This module estimates 2 models. One of them predicts the proportion of household travel occurring in single-occupant vehicle tours that have round trip distances of 20 miles or less. The other predicts the average length of trips in those tours.
#
#Two data frames from the VE2001NHTS package are used to develop these models. The Hh_df data frame includes attributes of households used as dependent variables in the models. The HhTours_df data frame is used to identify qualifying tours. The miles in qualifying tours is summed by household and added to the Hh_df data frame. The number of trips in qualifying tours is also summed by household. The average length of trips in qualifying SOV is calculated from the qualifying DVMT and trips. The average household DVMT model from the CalculateHouseholDvmt model is run to estimate the average DVMT of each survey household. Households having incomplete data (mostly because of missing income data) and zero vehicle households are removed from the dataset resulting in 51,924 household records.
#
#### Model of Proportion of DVMT in Qualifying SOV Tours
#
#The model is estimated in 2 stages. In the first stage, models are estimated to predict the likelihood that a household had no qualifying SOV tours on the survey day, and to predict the amount of DVMT in qualifying tours if there were one or more qualifying tours on the survey day. These two models are then applied stochastically to the survey households 1000 times and the results averaged to arrive at an estimate of the average DVMT in qualifying SOV tours for each household. The average household DVMT model from the CalculateHouseholDvmt module is also run and the ratio of estimated average DVMT in qualifying SOV tours is divided by the estimated average DVMT to arrive at an estimate of the average proportion of household DVMT that is in qualifying tours. In the second step, a linear model of the log odds corresponding to the proportions is estimated. In addition, the median trip length in qualifying tours is calculated.
#
#In the first stage of model development, a binomial logit model is estimated to predict the likelihood that a household had any qualifying SOV tours on the survey day. A linear model is also estimated which predicts the miles of travel in qualifying SOV tours if any. The summary statics for the estimation of the binomial logit model follows. The model accounts for a small proportion of the variability in the data, but all of the independent variables are highly significant. The number of children in the household and if the number of vehicles is less than the number of drivers increase the probability that the household had no qualifying SOV travel on the travel day. The population density of the neighborhood (block group), the number of drivers, and if the household lives in a single-family dwelling decreases the probability that the household had no qualifying SOV travel on the travel day. These effects are sensible.
#
#<txt:SovModel_ls$ZeroSovModel>
#
#The summary statistics for the linear model of qualifying SOV travel if any is shown below. In this model a power transform of the qualifying SOV DVMT is the dependent variable. Power transformation is done to help linearize the relationship since the qualifying SOV DVMT is highly skewed with a long right hand tail. The power transformation is calculated to minimize skewness of the distribution. As with the previous model, this one accounts for a small portion of the observed variability but the independent variables are highly significant. The amount of qualifying SOV DVMT increases with the income of the household, the number of drivers, and the household DVMT. The amount of qualifying SOV DVMT is decreased by the density of the neighborhood, the number of children in the household, and if the number of vehicles is less than the number of drivers.
#
#<txt:SovModel_ls$SovDvmtModel>
#
#The two models were applied jointly (using the estimation dataset) in a stochastic manner 1000 times to simulate that many travel days. In the case of the binomial logit model which predicts the likelihood of no qualifying SOV travel, the predicted probability for each simulated day is compared with a random draw from a uniform distribution in the range 0 to 1 to determine whether the household has any qualifying SOV travel. In the case of the linear model which predicts the amount of qualifying SOV travel, the model predictions are used to estimate the mean of a distribution from which a random draw is made. The standard deviation of the distribution is estimated so that the standard deviation of the estimates for the sample household population equals the standard deviation of the observed values for the population. The mean qualifying SOV DVMT for each household is calculated from the results of the 1000 simulations.
#
#The estimated average ratio of qualifying SOV DVMT to household average DVMT is calculated from the simulated results and the estimate of average DVMT calculated from applying the average DVMT model from the CalculateHouseholdDvmt module. A linear model of that ratio is estimated. In this model, the dependent variable is the logit of the ratio (log of the odds ratio). This keeps the predicted ratios in the range of 0 to 1 and does a better job of linearizing the relationship. The summary statistics for this model follow. The model explains almost all of the variability and all of the independent variables are highly significant. This is to be expected since the model estimates relationships derived from the two previous models.
#
#<txt:SovModel_ls$SovPropModel$Summary>
#
#The signs of the coefficients are sensible. The ratio of the average qualifying SOV DVMT of the household to the average DVMT of the household increases with:
#
#* Income - because higher income enables more discretionary travel and freedom to travel alone;
#
#* Drivers - because having more drivers increases the probability of solo travel and decreases the need to travel as a passenger;
#
#* Density - because higher density neighborhoods have more activity in close proximity and decrease the need for trip linking of multiple household members; and,
#
#* Single-family dwelling - because living in a single-family dwelling makes it easier to make spur-of-the-moment SOV trips because the vehicle is more accessible and there are usually no worries about finding a good parking space when arriving back home.
#
#The ratio of qualifying SOV DVMT decreases with increasing:
#
#* Number of children - because younger children often need to be taken along to shuttle them to activities or to maintain supervision while running errands;
#
#* Number of vehicles is less than the number of drivers - because when cars are not available for every driver it is more likely that they will need to travel together; and,
#
#* Household DVMT - because travel to work establishes a base level of vehicle travel and typically has lower vehicle occupancy than travel for other purposes. Travel beyond work travel is therefore less likely to be SOV travel than work travel and therefore will reduce the SOV DVMT ratio.
#
#### Model of Average Length of Trips in Qualifying SOV Tours
#
#A model of the average length in miles of trips in qualifying SOV tours is estimated in 2 stages as well. In the first stage a linear model of average trip length on the survey day is estimated. That model is applied in a simulation of 1000 days of travel and the average for each household are computed from the simulation. In the second stage, a linear model of the simulated averages is estimated. In each stage, separate models are estimated for metropolitan and non-metropolitan households to reflect the effect that freeway supply and urban mixed-use development have on trip length. For all of these models, the dependent variable is a power-transform of the SOV trip length. This is done to minimize the skewness of the distribution to help linearize the relationships. These models are estimated using the household records that have some qualifying SOV DVMT.
#
#Following are the summary estimation statistics for the linear model of the survey day average trip length for metropolitan households. While the model 'explains' a small percentage of the variation in average trip length, all of the terms are highly signficant and the signs of the coefficients are sensible. Average trip lengths increase with the number of drivers, amount of household income, and freeway supply. Average trip lengths decrease with the number of non-drivers, population density, in urban mixed-use neighborhoods, and if the household has fewer vehicles than drivers.
#
#<txt:SovModel_ls$MetroTrpLenModel>
#
#Following are the summary estimation statistics for the non-metropolitan linear model of survey day average trip length. As with the metropolitan model, this one 'explains' a small percentage of the observed variation in average SOV trip length, but all of the variables are highly significant. The missing the freeway supply and urban mixed-use neighborhood variables that are not available for non-metropolitan areas. It is also missing the non-driver variable which is found to be insignificant at the 5% level.
#
#<txt:SovModel_ls$NonMetroTrpLenModel>
#
#The travel day models are applied stochastically 1000 times to simulate day-to-day travel and calculate average values. In each simulation, the model predictions are used to estimate the mean of a distribution from which a random draw is made. The standard deviation of the distribution is estimated so that the standard deviation of the estimates for the sample household population equals the standard deviation of the observed values for the population. The values of the 1000 simulations are averaged for each household to calculate the average trip length for trips in qualifying SOV tours.
#
#Linear models are estimated for the simulated average trip lengths. The estimation statistics for the metropolitan and non-metropolitan models follow.

### How the Module Works
#
#This function calculates the proportional reduction in the DVMT of individual households to meet the user-supplied goal for diverting a proportion of travel in SOV tours 20 miles or less in length to bikes, electric bikes, scooters or other similar modes. The user supplies the diversion goal for each Azone and model year. The following procedural steps are followed to complete the calculation:
#
#* The SOV proportions model described is applied to calculate the proportion of the DVMT of each household that is in qualifying SOV tours (i.e. having lengths of 20 miles or less);
#
#* The total diversion of DVMT in qualifying SOV tours for the Azone is calculated by:
#
#  * Calculating the qualifying SOV tour DVMT of each household by multiplying the modeled proportion of DVMT in qualifying tours by the household DVMT;
#
#  * Summing the qualifying SOV tour DVMT of households in the Azone and multiplying by the diversion goal for the Azone;
#
#* The total DVMT diverted is allocated to households in the Azone as a function of their relative amounts of qualifying SOV travel and the inverse of the average length of trips in qualifying tours. In other words, it is assumed that households having more qualifying SOV travel and households having shorter SOV trips will be more likely to divert SOV travel. This is implemented in the following steps:
#
#  * A utility function is defined as follows:
#
#     `U = log(SovDvmt / mean(SovDvmt)) + B * log(TripLength / mean(TripLength))`
#
#     Where:
#
#     `SovDvmt` and `mean(SovDvmt)` are the household's qualifying SOV DVMT and the population mean respectively,
#
#     `TripLength` and `mean(TripLength)` are the household's average qualifying SOV trip length and the population mean respectively, and
#
#     `B` is a parameter that is estimated to keep the maximum proportion of SOV diversion for all households within bounds as explained below.
#
#  * The proportion of total diverted DVMT allocated to each household is `exp(U) / sum(exp(U))` where `exp(U)` is the exponentiated value of the utility for the household and `sum(exp(U))` is the sum of the exponentiated values for all households.
#
#  * The value of `B` is solved such that the maximum proportional diversion for any household is midway between the objective of the Azone and 1. For example, if the Azone objective is 0.2, the maximum diversion would be 0.6. The value is solved iteratively using a binary search algorithm.
#
#* The DVMT diversion allocated to each household is divided by the average DVMT of each household to calculate the proportion of household DVMT that is diverted. This and the average trip length by household are outputs to be saved in the datastore.

#' \code{DivertSovTravel} calculates the proportion of household DVMT that is

#' This function calculates the proportion of household DVMT that is diverted to
#' meet Azone SOV diversion goals. It calculates the amount of SOV travel
#' of each households that is in tours having round-trip distances of 20 miles

#' diverted. It then allocates the DVMT to be diverted as a function of the
#' household's alternative mode trip making, assuming that households that are
#' predicted to make more alternative mode trips would be more likely to make
#' additional diversions. Finally, it calculates the proportion of DVMT diverted
